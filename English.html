<h1>About Our Project</h1>
<p class="p">Server (English server — "maid", from English to serve — to serve, plural of servers) — in computer terminology, the term can refer to a separate computer or program. The main feature in both cases is the ability of a machine or program to work autonomously most of the time, without human. This is often done by individual highly qualified server administrators.<br><b><i>LetsMine</i></b>-this is a Ukrainian RP (English Roleplay) project made for a pleasant game for Ukrainians and foreigners. 
    It is developed by a team of teenagers who modernize the project every day and try to make something out of it
    more interesting. Also, there are additional datapacks on the server developed by the team itself and everything for a convenient RP</p>
